# RoboticsStage

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of robotics projects focused on AI, machine learning, and explainability. The goal is to demonstrate advanced skills in robotics simulation, reinforcement learning, and interpretable AI systems, aligning with the missions of companies like xAI, Anthropic, and Thinking Machine Labs.

## Projects
- **[ExplainableRoboticArm](ExplainableRoboticArm/)**: A robotic arm simulator that learns to pick and place objects using reinforcement learning (PPO), with SHAP explanations for its decisions and a Tkinter GUI for interaction.
